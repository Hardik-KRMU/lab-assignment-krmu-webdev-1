Hey there! Welcome to my portfolio project.
This is a simple one-page website that I built to learn and practice HTML while creating something useful for myself

Tags Used
Here are the main HTML tags I practiced with:
Header: <header>, <h1>, <nav>, <a>, <ul>, <li>
Main: <main>, <section>, <h2>, <p>, <a>, <img>, <ul>, <li>, <br>
Table: <table>, <thead>, <tr>, <th>, <tbody>, <td>
Form: <form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea>

Why I Made This
The goal was simple:
ðŸ‘‰ Learn HTML.
ðŸ‘‰ Build a portfolio I can improve later.
ðŸ‘‰ Test my knowledge by putting everything into one project.
